# Magical Alexa-Spotify-CD Box


For Christmas, I signed myself up for the "Creative Engineering with Mark Rober". As part of the class we have to build something with an Arduino. Here is my project. I will have a full build video on my YouTube channel in a few weeks, but this turned out so sweet I couldn't wait to share it.

I have post four videos for the project:

Progress: https://youtu.be/dpDbMA8f0VY
Final Result: https://youtu.be/H2HJ-LY7-lQ | https://youtu.be/isom4NREq14

For my final project in the Creative Engineering with Mark Rober class, I submit to you my magic Alexa-Spotify-CD box. 
I just don't have the heart to throw out all my old CDs and thought this project might give them a second life. I took an 
esp32 microcontroller, hooked a RFID-RC522 reader to it, and wrote some code to read a Spotify link from NFC tags that I 
place on the CD cases and make a API call to Spotify to play that album on the Echo Dot that I mounted into a Walnut and 
Birdseye Maple case that I built.
